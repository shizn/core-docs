  summary: "\n<p>Specifies the block cipher mode to use for encryption.</p>\n"
  remarks: "\n<p>Block cipher algorithms encrypt data in block units, rather than a single byte at a time. The most common block size is 8 bytes. Because each block is heavily processed, block ciphers provide a higher level of security than stream ciphers. However, block cipher algorithms tend to execute more slowly than stream ciphers.</p>\n<p>Block ciphers use the same encryption algorithm for each block. Because of this, a block of plain text will always return the same cipher text when encrypted with the same key and algorithm. Because this behavior can be used to crack a cipher, cipher modes are introduced that modify the encryption process based on feedback from earlier block encryptions. The resulting encryption provides a higher level of security than a simple block encryption.</p>\n"

  summary: "\n<p>The Cipher Block Chaining (<strong>CBC</strong>) mode introduces feedback. Before each plain text block is encrypted, it is combined with the cipher text of the previous block by a bitwise exclusive OR operation. This ensures that even if the plain text contains many identical blocks, they will each encrypt to a different cipher text block. The initialization vector is combined with the first plain text block by a bitwise exclusive OR operation before the block is encrypted. If a single bit of the cipher text block is mangled, the corresponding plain text block will also be mangled. In addition, a bit in the subsequent block, in the same position as the original mangled bit, will be mangled.</p>\n"

  summary: "\n<p>The Electronic Codebook (<strong>ECB</strong>) mode encrypts each block individually. Any blocks of plain text that are identical and in the same message, or that are in a different message encrypted with the same key, will be transformed into identical cipher text blocks. Important:  This mode is not recommended because it opens the door for multiple security exploits. If the plain text to be encrypted contains substantial repetition, it is feasible for the cipher text to be broken one block at a time. It is also possible to use block analysis to determine the encryption key. Also, an active adversary can substitute and exchange individual blocks without detection, which allows blocks to be saved and inserted into the stream at other points without detection.</p>\n"
