  summary: "\n<p>Encapsulates a method that has seven parameters and returns a value of the type specified by the <em>TResult</em> parameter.</p>\n"
  remarks: "\n<p>You can use this delegate to represent a method that can be passed as a parameter without explicitly declaring a custom delegate. The encapsulated method must correspond to the method signature that is defined by this delegate. This means that the encapsulated method must have seven parameters, each of which is passed to it by value, and that it must return a value.</p>\n<p>To reference a method that has seven parameters and returns <strong>void</strong> (or in Visual Basic, that is declared as a <strong>Sub</strong> rather than as a <strong>Function</strong>), use the generic <xref href=\"System.Action`7\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> delegate instead. </p>\n<p>You can also use the <xref href=\"System.Func`8\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> delegate with anonymous methods and lambda expressions.</p>\n<p>The underlying type of a lambda expression is one of the generic <strong>Func</strong> delegates. This makes it possible to pass a lambda expression as a parameter without explicitly assigning it to a delegate.</p>\n"
