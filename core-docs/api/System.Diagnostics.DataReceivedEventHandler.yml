  summary: "\n<p>Represents the method that will handle the <xref href=\"System.Diagnostics.Process.OutputDataReceived\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> event or <xref href=\"System.Diagnostics.Process.ErrorDataReceived\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> event of a <xref href=\"System.Diagnostics.Process\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref>.</p>\n"
  remarks: "\n<p>When you create a <xref href=\"System.Diagnostics.DataReceivedEventHandler\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> delegate, you identify the method that will handle the event. To associate the event with your event handler, add an instance of the delegate to the event. The event handler is called whenever the event occurs, unless you remove the delegate. For more information about event-handler delegates, see Handling and Raising Events.</p>\n<p>To asynchronously collect the redirected <xref href=\"System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardOutput\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> or <xref href=\"System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardError\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> stream output of a process, add your event handler to the <xref href=\"System.Diagnostics.Process.OutputDataReceived\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> or <xref href=\"System.Diagnostics.Process.ErrorDataReceived\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> event. These events are raised each time the process writes a line to the corresponding redirected stream. When the redirected stream is closed, a null line is sent to the event handler. Ensure that your event handler checks for this condition before accessing the <xref href=\"System.Diagnostics.DataReceivedEventArgs.Data\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> property. For example, you can use the <strong>static</strong> method <xref href=\"System.String.IsNullOrEmpty(System.String)\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> to validate the <xref href=\"System.Diagnostics.DataReceivedEventArgs.Data\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> property in your event handler.</p>\n"
  example:
  - "\n<p>The following code example illustrates how to perform asynchronous read operations on the redirected <xref href=\"System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardOutput\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> stream of the sort command. The sort command is a console application that reads and sorts text input.</p>\n<p>The example creates a <xref href=\"System.Diagnostics.DataReceivedEventHandler\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> delegate for the <code>SortOutputHandler</code> event handler and associates the delegate with the <xref href=\"System.Diagnostics.Process.OutputDataReceived\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> event. The event handler receives text lines from the redirected <xref href=\"System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardOutput\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> stream, formats the text, and writes the text to the screen.</p>Process_AsyncStreams#1"
