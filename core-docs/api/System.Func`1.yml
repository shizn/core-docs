  summary: "\n<p>Encapsulates a method that has no parameters and returns a value of the type specified by the <em>TResult</em> parameter.</p>\n"
  remarks: "\n<p>You can use this delegate to represent a method that can be passed as a parameter without explicitly declaring a custom delegate. The encapsulated method must correspond to the method signature that is defined by this delegate. This means that the encapsulated method must have no parameters and must return a value.</p>\n<p>To reference a method that has no parameters and returns <strong>void</strong> (or in Visual Basic, that is declared as a <strong>Sub</strong> rather than as a <strong>Function</strong>), use the <xref href=\"System.Action\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> delegate instead. </p>\n<p>When you use the <xref href=\"System.Func`1\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> delegate, you do not have to explicitly define a delegate that encapsulates a parameterless method. For example, the following code explicitly declares a delegate named <code>WriteMethod</code> and assigns a reference to the <code>OutputTarget.SendToFile</code> instance method to its delegate instance. </p>System.Func~1#1<p>The following example simplifies this code by instantiating the <xref href=\"System.Func`1\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> delegate instead of explicitly defining a new delegate and assigning a named method to it. </p>System.Func~1#2<p>You can use the <xref href=\"System.Func`1\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> delegate with anonymous methods in C#, as the following example illustrates. (For an introduction to anonymous methods, see Anonymous Methods (C# Programming Guide).)</p>System.Func~1#3<p>You can also assign a lambda expression to a <xref href=\"System.Func`2\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> delegate, as the following example illustrates. (For an introduction to lambda expressions, see Lambda Expressions (Visual Basic) and Lambda Expressions (C# Programming Guide).)</p>System.Func~1#4<p>The underlying type of a lambda expression is one of the generic <strong>Func</strong> delegates. This makes it possible to pass a lambda expression as a parameter without explicitly assigning it to a delegate. In particular, because many methods of types in the <xref href=\"System.Linq\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> namespace have <strong>Func</strong> parameters, you can pass these methods a lambda expression without explicitly instantiating a <strong>Func</strong> delegate.</p><p>If you have an expensive computation that you want to execute only if the result is actually needed, you can assign the expensive function to a <xref href=\"System.Func`1\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> delegate. The execution of the function can then be delayed until a property that accesses the value is used in an expression. The example in the next section demonstrates how to do this.</p>"
  example:
  - "\n<p>The following example demonstrates how to use a delegate that takes no parameters. This code creates a generic class named <code>LazyValue</code> that has a field of type <xref href=\"System.Func`1\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref>. This delegate field can store a reference to any function that returns a value of the type that corresponds to the type parameter of the <code>LazyValue</code> object. The <code>LazyValue</code> type also has a <code>Value</code> property that executes the function (if it has not already been executed) and returns the resulting value.</p>\n<p>The example creates two methods and instantiates two <code>LazyValue</code> objects with lambda expressions that call these methods. The lambda expressions do not take parameters because they just need to call a method. As the output shows, the two methods are executed only when the value of each <code>LazyValue</code> object is retrieved.</p>System.Func~1#5"
