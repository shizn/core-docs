  summary: "\n<p>Defines different rules for determining the first week of the year.</p>\n"
  remarks: "\n<p>A member of the <xref href=\"System.Globalization.CalendarWeekRule\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> enumeration is returned by the <xref href=\"System.Globalization.DateTimeFormatInfo.CalendarWeekRule\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> property and is used by the culture's current calendar to determine the calendar week rule. The enumeration value is also used as a parameter to the <xref href=\"System.Globalization.Calendar.GetWeekOfYear(System.DateTime,System.Globalization.CalendarWeekRule,System.DayOfWeek)\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> method. </p>\n<p>Calendar week rules depend on the <xref href=\"System.DayOfWeek\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> value that indicates the first day of the week in addition to depending on a <xref href=\"System.Globalization.CalendarWeekRule\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> value. The <xref href=\"System.Globalization.DateTimeFormatInfo.FirstDayOfWeek\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> property provides the default value for a culture, but any <xref href=\"System.DayOfWeek\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> value can be specified as the first day of the week in the <xref href=\"System.Globalization.Calendar.GetWeekOfYear(System.DateTime,System.Globalization.CalendarWeekRule,System.DayOfWeek)\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> method.</p>\n<p>The first week based on the <xref href=\"System.Globalization.CalendarWeekRule.FirstDay\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> value can have one to seven days. The first week based on the <xref href=\"System.Globalization.CalendarWeekRule.FirstFullWeek\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> value always has seven days. The first week based on the <xref href=\"System.Globalization.CalendarWeekRule.FirstFourDayWeek\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> value can have four to seven days.</p>\n<p>For example, in the Gregorian calendar, suppose that the first day of the year (January 1) falls on a Tuesday and the designated first day of the week is Sunday. Selecting <xref href=\"System.Globalization.CalendarWeekRule.FirstFullWeek\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> defines the first Sunday (January 6) as the beginning of the first week of the year. The first five days of the year are considered part of the last week of the previous year. In contrast, selecting <xref href=\"System.Globalization.CalendarWeekRule.FirstFourDayWeek\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> defines the first day of the year (January 1) as the beginning of the first week of the year because there are more than four days from January 1 to the day before the following Sunday.</p>\n<p>Date </p>\n<p>FirstDay </p>\n<p>FirstFullWeek </p>\n<p>FirstFourDayWeek </p>\n<p>Suppose the first day of the year (January 1) falls on a Friday and the designated first day of the week is Sunday. Selecting <xref href=\"System.Globalization.CalendarWeekRule.FirstFourDayWeek\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> defines the first Sunday (January 3) as the beginning of the first week of the year because there are fewer than four days from January 1 to the day before the following Sunday.</p>\n<p>Date </p>\n<p>FirstDay </p>\n<p>FirstFullWeek </p>\n<p>FirstFourDayWeek </p>\n<p>The following example illustrates how the <xref href=\"System.Globalization.CalendarWeekRule\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> and <xref href=\"System.DayOfWeek\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> values are used together to determine how weeks are assigned. In the Gregorian calendar, the first day of the year (January 1) in 2013 falls on a Tuesday. If the designated first day of the week is Sunday, the first Sunday (January 6) is the first day of the first week of the year, and Saturday (January 5) belongs to the fifty-third week of the previous year. Changing the calendar week rule to <xref href=\"System.Globalization.CalendarWeekRule.FirstFourDayWeek\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> defines Tuesday (January 1) as the beginning of the first week of the year, because there are more than four days between Tuesday, January 1, and Sunday, January 6. Using this rule, January 5 belongs to the first week of the year. For 2010, a year in which January 1 falls on a Friday, applying the <xref href=\"System.Globalization.CalendarWeekRule.FirstFourDayWeek\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> rule with <xref href=\"System.DayOfWeek.Sunday\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> as the first day of the week makes Sunday, January 3 the beginning of the first week of the year, because the first week in 2010 that has more than four days is January 3 through 9. </p>System.Globalization.CalendarWeekRule#1<p>This does not map exactly to ISO 8601. The differences are discussed in the blog entry <see href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=160851\">ISO 8601 Week of Year format in Microsoft .Net</see>.</p><p>Each <xref href=\"System.Globalization.CultureInfo\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> object supports a set of calendars. The <xref href=\"System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Calendar\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> property returns the default calendar for the culture, and the <xref href=\"System.Globalization.CultureInfo.OptionalCalendars\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> property returns an array containing all the calendars supported by the culture. To change the calendar used by a <xref href=\"System.Globalization.CultureInfo\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref>, the application should set the <xref href=\"System.Globalization.DateTimeFormatInfo.Calendar\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> property of <xref href=\"System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DateTimeFormat\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> to a new <xref href=\"System.Globalization.Calendar\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref>.</p><p></p>"
