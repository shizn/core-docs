  summary: "\n<p>Represents the status of an asynchronous operation. </p>\n"
  remarks: "\n<p>The <xref href=\"System.IAsyncResult\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> interface is implemented by classes containing methods that can operate asynchronously. It is the return type of methods that initiate an asynchronous operation, such as <xref href=\"System.IO.FileStream.BeginRead(System.Byte[],System.Int32,System.Int32,System.AsyncCallback,System.Object)\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref>, and it is passed to methods that conclude an asynchronous operation, such as <xref href=\"System.IO.FileStream.EndRead(System.IAsyncResult)\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref>. <xref href=\"System.IAsyncResult\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> objects are also passed to methods invoked by <xref href=\"System.AsyncCallback\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> delegates when an asynchronous operation completes.</p>\n<p>An object that supports the <xref href=\"System.IAsyncResult\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> interface stores state information for an asynchronous operation and provides a synchronization object to allow threads to be signaled when the operation completes.</p>\n<p>The <xref href=\"System.Runtime.Remoting.Messaging.AsyncResult\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> class is the implementation of <xref href=\"System.IAsyncResult\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> that is returned by the <strong>BeginInvoke</strong> method when you use a delegate to call a method asynchronously.</p>\n<p>For a detailed description of how the <xref href=\"System.IAsyncResult\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> interface is used, see the Calling Synchronous Methods Asynchronously topic.</p>\n"
  example:
  - "\n<p>The following example demonstrates how to use the <xref href=\"System.Runtime.Remoting.Messaging.AsyncResult.AsyncWaitHandle\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> property to get a <xref href=\"System.Threading.WaitHandle\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref>, and how to wait for an asynchronous call on a delegate.
