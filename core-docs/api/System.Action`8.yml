  summary: "\n<p>Encapsulates a method that has eight parameters and does not return a value.</p>\n"
  remarks: "\n<p>You can use the <xref href=\"System.Action`8\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> delegate to pass a method as a parameter without explicitly declaring a custom delegate. The encapsulated method must correspond to the method signature that is defined by this delegate. This means that the encapsulated method must have eight parameters that are all passed to it by value, and it must not return a value. (In C#, the method must return <strong>void</strong>. In Visual Basic, it must be defined by the <strong>Sub</strong>â€¦<strong>End Sub</strong> construct. It can also be a method that returns a value that is ignored.) Typically, such a method is used to perform an operation.</p>\n<p>To reference a method that has eight parameters and returns a value, use the generic <xref href=\"System.Func`9\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> delegate instead.</p>\n<p>You can also use the <xref href=\"System.Action`8\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> delegate with anonymous methods and lambda expressions.</p>\n"
