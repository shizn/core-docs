  remarks: "\n<p>This delegate is used to construct instances of the <xref href=\"System.Net.Security.SslStream\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> class. The <xref href=\"System.Net.Security.SslStream\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> class is used to help secure information exchanged between a client and server. The client and server use this delegate to select a certificate to be used for authentication.</p>\n"
