  summary: "\n<p>Verifies the remote Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate used for authentication.</p>\n"
  remarks: "\n<p>The delegate's <em>sslPolicyErrors</em> argument contains any certificate errors returned by SSPI while authenticating the client or server. The <xref href=\"System.Boolean\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> value returned by the method invoked by this delegate determines whether the authentication is allowed to succeed.</p>\n<p>This delegate is used with the <xref href=\"System.Net.Security.SslStream\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> class.</p>\n"
  example:
  - "\n<p>The following code example implements a method that is invoked by an instance of the <xref href=\"System.Net.Security.RemoteCertificateValidationCallback\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> class. If there are validation errors, this method displays them and returns <strong>false</strong>, which prevents communication with the unauthenticated server.</p>NCLSslClientSync#1<p>The following code example creates the delegate using the method defined in the preceding code example. </p>NCLSslClientSync#4"
