#  The main trio: C#, F# and Visual Basic

Microsoft offers three languages that support .NET Core: C#, F#, and Visual Basic.

C# is simple, powerful, type-safe, and object-oriented while retaining the expressiveness and elegance of C-style languages. Anyone familiar with C and similar languages will find few problems in adapting to C#.

F# is a cross-platform, functional-first programming language that also supports traditional object-oriented and imperative programming.

Visual Basic is a productive, type-safe and object-oriented language that you can use to build a variety of applications that run on .NET Core.

> **Note**
> 
> In the current RC2 release only C# is fully supported.
