# .NET Platform & programming languages

As a developer, you can choose any programming language that supports the .NET Platform to create your application. Because the .NET Platform provides language independence and interoperability, you can interact with other .NET applications and components regardless of the language with which they were developed.

Languages that allow you to develop applications for the .NET Platform adhere to the [Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) specification](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/mt639507).

Microsoft languages that support .NET Core include C#, F#, and Visual Basic. For more information see [The main trio: C#, F# and Visual Basic](http://dotnet.github.io/docs/languages/main-trio.html).
